##Project Question##

**What is the question you hope to answer?**

Can we predict a woman's general health based on existing structural disadvantages like race and socioeconomic status?

**Corollary questions**

Can we predict the CHANGE in a woman's general health over time based on existing structural disadvantages?

*What's structural disadvantage?* Structural disadvantages (or [structural inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_inequality)) is "a condition where one category of people are attributed an unequal status in relation to other categories of people". These unequal statuses are often systematically reinforced and are usually represented by race, gender, and socioeconomic status. In my dataset I am looking to represent structural disadvantage by race and SES.

*How can you measure general health?* There's something called ["allostatic load"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allostatic_load) that's been used in research to represent the "wear and tear" on the body as a function of repeated exposure to stress on the body. There are a couple different ways to calculate allostatic load, and it depends on the data that you have available. Roughly speaking you give a score for each biomarker based on which quartile they fall under for the population and then you add up the scores to get a composite measure of health.

**What data are you planning to use to answer that question?**

The [Study of Women's Health Across the Nation](http://www.swanstudy.org/) is a really cool and popular data set "designed to examine the health of women during their middle years". Starting in the late 90s, researchers recruited ~3K women to participate in this assessment every two years. The assessment measures physical, biological, psychological, and social changes during a woman's middle years.

**What do you know about the data so far?**

It's big. There are 13 data sets available to the [public](http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/series/00253) and each site visit collects roughly 700 variables of information from each participant (questions on medication, sexual behavior, medical conditions, perceptions to discrimination, etc).The data is readily available, but the actual exploration and manipulation of the data will be challenging.

**Why did you choose this topic?**

I'm getting my MPH in Epidemiology and I'm focusing on health disparities and minority health. I'm really interested in weathering, which is how health deteriorates in early adulthood as a physical consequence of stress induced by structural disadvantage.
