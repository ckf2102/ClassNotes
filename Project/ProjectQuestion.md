#Project Question#

**What is the question you hope to answer?**

Can we predict a woman's general health based on existing structural disadvantages like race and socioeconomic 

status?

**Corollary questions**

Can we predict the CHANGE in a woman's general health over time based on existing structural disadvantages?

*What's structural disadvantage?* Structural disadvantages (or [structural inequality]

(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_inequality)) is "a condition where one category of people are attributed 

an unequal status in relation to other categories of people". These unequal statuses are often systematically 

reinforced and are usually represented by race, gender, and socioeconomic status.

*How can you measure general health?* There's something called ["allostatic load"]

(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allostatic_load) that's been used in research to represent the "wear and tear" on 

the body as a function of repeated exposure to stress on the body. There are a couple different ways to calculate 

allostatic load, and it depends on the data that you have available. 

*What data are you planning to use to answer that question?*

The [Study of Women's Health Across the Nation](http://www.swanstudy.org/) is a really cool and popular data set 

"designed to examine the health of women during their middle years". Starting in the late 90s, researchers 

recruited ~3K women to participate in this assessment every two years. The assessment measures physical, 

biological, psychological, and social changes during a woman's middle years.

What do you know about the data so far?

The data set is massive. There are 13 data sets available to the [public]

(http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/series/00253) and each site visit collects roughly 700 variables of 

information from each participant.The data is readily available, but the actual exploration and manipulation of the 

data will be challenging.
