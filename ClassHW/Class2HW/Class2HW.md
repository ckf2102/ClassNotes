### due 8 June 2015

*** Question 1 ***

Using chipotle.tsv in the data subdirectory:

Look at the head and the tail, and think for a minute about how the data is structured. What do you think each column means? What do you think each row means? Tell me! (If you're unsure, look at more of the file contents.)

How many orders do there appear to be?

How many lines are in the file?

Which burrito is more popular, steak or chicken?

Do chicken burritos more often have black beans or pinto beans?
