##Intro to Data Science##
###1 June 2015###

*What is a data scientist?*
- Some blend between statistics and software engineering
- Not necessarily a master, but has variety of skill sets
- Makes data useful using coding and statistical skills
- Type A: Analysis, concerned with making sense of data, working with it in a static way
	- Similar to statistician, but knows all practical details of working with data that aren’t taught in statistics (data cleaning, large data sets, visualization, etc)
- Type B: Building, some stat but strong coder or software engineer
	- Using data “in production”; building models which interact with users

*Data Science Workflow*
- From Harvard Data Science
	- Ask an interesting question
What is the scientific goal?
What would you do if you had all the data?
What do you want to predict or estimate
Get the data (and clean it!)
How were the data sampled?
Which data are relevant?
Are there privacy issues?
Explore the data
Plot the data
Are there anomalies?
Are there patterns?
Model the data (machine learning)
Build the model
Fit the model
Validate the model
Communicate and visualize results
What did we learn?
Did the results make sense?

Course Project

July 8 - midpoint presentation, only 5 minutes but still requires slides, code, etc

Austin’s Project
Hypothesis: good bus predictions are likely to improve ridership and user satisfaction
And the opposite
Question: how good are the NextBus predictions and can we mash up that with other data predictions?

What is data?
Flat file: rows and columns
Rows = objects
Columns = measurement on objects
Text data: represented as a sparse matrix
Text Documents (row)
Word ID (column)
Words represented by counts and are plotted
Transactional based data: a log
Represented as time series
Relational Data
Most large data sets are stored in relational data sets
Multiple tables linked together
Time series data
Image data
Spatio-temporal data
Network data
